== General Notes about this assignment ==

Place your comments or requests here for Min to read.  Discuss your
architecture or experiments in general.  A paragraph or two is usually
sufficient.

I am using python 3.6 for this project. 

indexing
Reads each file from a directory, and gets a list of unique words in the 
file (The data structure looks like [word, doc_ID]. Do this for all the 
files in that directory. Then merge to a big table that looks something 
like [word, list of doc_ID]. Then save dictionary and posting to disk.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
searching
We first parse the queries to infix notation by using the shunting yard
algorithm. Then, we get a list of queries all in infix notations. we
feed it to a recursive function that calculates the query for us.

== Files included with this submission ==

List the files in your submission here and provide a short 1 line
description of each file.  Make sure your submission's files are named
and formatted correctly.

index.py - Index all the text files in that directory, and saves to disk
node.py - Represents each dictionary item
queryParser.py - Parses the query to infix notation using the shunting
yard algorithm
search.py - Answers the query by looking in the disk of the postings file
and writing it to the output file

stackoverflow for manipulating python data structures (such as how are foreach loop is sytaxtically written in python) 
Professor's python slides for various python data structures/file IO things (very helpful!)

more stackoverflow for how to use pickle, and various python libraries 

Googled a ton on the shunting yard algorithm, also read the algorithm on wikipedia

Basically copied the professor's given skeleton from HW1 for input commands from terminal
